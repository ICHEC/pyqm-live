# Python For Quantum Mechanics

## Description
Welcome to Python for Quantum Mechanics. This course was designed to give you a solid foundation in the Python programming language for your studies in quantum technology. The course is six sessions long in total, and builds from the ground up a working knowledge of Python, with emphasis on the NumPy, Matplotlib and SciPy libraries. The first three sessions entail the building of a foundation, where you will learn how to manipulate basic data types in the first session, all the way to object-oriented programming in the third session. The final three sessions involve a deep dive into the afore-mentioned libraries.

The course material will be hosted on GitHub and includes a folder for each session which includes a complete set of notebooks with the video lectures embedded as well as a README where links to the videos can also be found. There will be a live tutorial each week on Tuesday at 3am in the SNIAM basement lecture hall. The Discord, linked above, server also serves as a place of communication, where questions can be asked and discussions held.
